    "At this point we could rave on about company pedigree and vision for the future (blah blah yawn) but that's simply not our way. Much better that you get to know us - we'd love for you to come in and let us show you how committed we are to a better coffee experience.",
    "Yes - we are coffee roasters but we're more than that and if you want to know more, read on or get in touch (otherwise the route to good coffee is simply the Shop tab at the top).",
    "It's probably worth dropping into conversation we continuously strive to source the best quality raw product possible. Looking in all sorts of direction globally. We aim to source coffee that scores 82 points or above on the SCA scale for quality for all of our blends; and 84+ for our single origins as a minimum starting point.",
    "A word on our pricing. Yes, we seem cheap for people who strive for the best quality speciality coffee, we get that. We believe that you the consumer shouldn't have to pay extortionate amounts just because the coffee is expensive. Our packaging may not be as sexy as the next roaster, but we believe the coffee is what you should pay for, not the box it might come in.  We are looking into a 'sexy packaging' optional upgrade for all our products in the near future, worry not!",
    "We also actually like our staff. Yep. We believe in the simple philosophy that happy passionate staff in a fun working environment equals satisfied customers.",
    "We're very proud of the personable service you'll experience in the thriving cafe attached to our roastery -  it's like we've got our own little coffee community going on. Don't just take our word for it though, come park yourself inside for a brew and see us all in action.",
    "Alright... enough already. We'll put the trumpet down. In a nutshell we simply want to serve you the best coffee you've ever had. Now how's that for company vision?!!",
